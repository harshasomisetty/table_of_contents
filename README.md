# Table_of_contents

This project is a wrapper on PDFTK to easily add a navigable table of contents to a pdf. 

Too often, pdfs online don't come with TOC in their structure, which results in lots of scrolling. Although tools exist for one to add their own TOC, this notebook greatly simplifies the project.

To use, please clone this repo, and make sure you have PDFTK-server installed from this [link](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/)

Then, follow the comments in the python notebook
